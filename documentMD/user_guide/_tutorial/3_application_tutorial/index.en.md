In this tutorial, you use Fugaku to create and execute workflows using applications such as OpenFOAM and TensorFlow.

From now on, it is assumed that you can access Fugaku with the name __fugaku__ as the remote host.
Before you start the tutorial, create a remote host configuration for Fugaku.

For information about how to create remote host settings, see [Remote Host Settings for Administrators]({{site.baseurl}}/for_admins/how_to_boot/#remote-host-settings).

__About Verifying Application Operation__  
In March 2023, we confirmed the operation of the application (OpenFOAM, TensorFlow) used in the practical tutorial.
