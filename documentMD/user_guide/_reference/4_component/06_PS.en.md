The ParameterStudy component (The following PS components)
Within the parameter space specified in parameterFile
Execute the lower components as parallel as possible for all combinations.


The following properties can be set for PS components:

### parameterFile
Specifies the parameter configuration file (Json file) that defines the parameter space.  
Since parameterSetting.json is specified by default, select it from the Files area and edit it in the text editor screen.  
Use the PS-config mode of the [Text Editor Screen]({{site.baseurl}}/reference/3_workflow_screen/3_editor.html#ps-config-mode) to create the parameterFile.

### force overwrite
When you create a directory with parameters,
Sets whether to overwrite existing directories even if they exist.

### delete all instances
Specifies whether to remove the directory for individual copied parameters at the end of execution.


### PS Component Run-time Behavior
The PS component reads the parameter configuration file at the start of execution.
directories corresponding to all combinations in the defined parameter space.
Create it by copying its own directory.

In this case, the file set to `targetFiles` in the parameter configuration file is not a simple copy.
The placeholders in the file are rewritten and copied to the parameter settings.

Also, a file set to `scatter` can be set to
Only the necessary directories are renamed and copied.
You can also use parameter values as names.

The components in the copied directory are executed in parallel, but
Task components are executed in parallel within the limit of the number of concurrent executions.

At the end of component execution for all parameters
Only files set to `gather` are collected under the original directory.
Again, you can rename the file using the value of the parameter.
If files with the same name, such as application execution result files, have been created, use this function to rename and collect them.

__About files not specified by the gather feature__  
Files not specified by the gather function are not erased unless `delete all instances` is specified.  
However, it is placed in a directory that is not accessible from the WHEEL GUI, and cannot be accessed after execution is finished.
